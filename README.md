# Legal Agent Reliability Benchmark (QC-Sentinel)

## Overview
This repository contains ongoing research investigating reliability, hallucination mitigation, and citation grounding in tool-augmented AI agent systems.

The project studies how large language models behave within modular agent workflows operating in legal-domain analytical environments.

## Research Goals
- Evaluate citation grounding reliability
- Reduce hallucinations through verification layers
- Study agent workflow robustness
- Benchmark structured reasoning stability

## Methodology
The research introduces a modular verification framework ("QC-Sentinel") that evaluates intermediate reasoning outputs before downstream execution.

Experiments focus on:
- Prompt perturbation robustness
- Tool interaction stability
- Failure recovery behavior
- Alignment consistency

## Status
🚧 Research initialization phase  
Benchmark framework under active development.

## Planned Outputs
- Reproducible benchmark methodology
- Open documentation
- Reliability evaluation reports
